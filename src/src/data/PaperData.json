    "month": "Jan",
    "abstract": "Temperature intrinsically influences all aspects of biochemical and biophysical \r\nprocesses. Organisms have therefore evolved strategies to buffer themselves against \r\nthermal perturbations. Many organisms also use temperature signals as cues to align \r\nbehavior and development with certain seasons. These developmentally important \r\nthermosensory mechanisms have generally been studied in constant temperature \r\nconditions. However, environmental temperature is an inherently noisy signal, and it \r\nhas been unclear how organisms reliably extract specific temperature cues from \r\nfluctuating temperature profiles. In this context, we discuss plant thermosensory \r\nresponses, focusing on temperature sensing throughout vernalization in Arabidopsis. \r\nWe highlight many different timescales of sensing, which has led to the proposal of \r\na distributed thermosensing paradigm. Within this paradigm, we suggest a \r\nclassification system for thermosensors. Finally, we focus on the longest timescale, \r\nwhich is most important for sensing winter, and examine the different mechanisms in \r\nwhich memory of cold exposure can be achieved.",

    "year": "2020",
    "month": "Oct",
    "abstract": "Plants have adapted to tolerate and survive constantly changing environmental conditions by \r\nreprogramming gene expression in response to stress or to drive developmental transitions. Among the many \r\nsignals that plants perceive, light and temperature are of particular interest due to their intensely \r\nfluctuating nature which is combined with a long-term seasonal trend. Whereas specific receptors are key \r\nin the light-sensing mechanism, the identity of plant thermosensors for high and low temperatures remains \r\nfar from fully addressed. This review aims at discussing common as well as divergent characteristics of \r\ngene expression regulation in plants, controlled by light and temperature. Light and temperature signaling \r\ncontrol the abundance of specific transcription factors, as well as the dynamics of co-transcriptional \r\nprocesses such as RNA polymerase elongation rate and alternative splicing patterns. Additionally, sensing \r\nboth types of cues modulates gene expression by altering the chromatin landscape and through the induction \r\nof long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). However, while light sensing is channeled through dedicated receptors, \r\ntemperature can broadly affect chemical reactions inside plant cells. Thus, direct thermal modifications of \r\nthe transcriptional machinery add another level of complexity to plant transcriptional regulation. Besides \r\nthe rapid transcriptome changes that follow perception of environmental signals, plant developmental transitions \r\nand acquisition of stress tolerance depend on long-term maintenance of transcriptional states (active or \r\nsilenced genes). Thus, the rapid transcriptional response to the signal (Phase I) can be distinguished from \r\nthe long-term memory of the acquired transcriptional state (Phase II – remembering the signal). In this review \r\nwe discuss recent advances in light and temperature signal perception, integration and memory in Arabidopsis \r\nthaliana, focusing on transcriptional regulation and highlighting the contrasting and unique features of each \r\ntype of cue in the process.",

    "year": "2020",
    "month": "Jul",
    "abstract": "Temperature is a key factor in the growth and development of all organisms. Plants have to \r\ninterpret temperature fluctuations, over hourly to monthly timescales, to align their growth and development \r\nwith the seasons. Much is known about how plants respond to acute thermal stresses, but the mechanisms that \r\nintegrate long-term temperature exposure remain unknown. The slow, winter-long upregulation of *VERNALIZATION \r\nINSENSITIVE 3* (*VIN3*), a PHD protein that functions with Polycomb repressive complex 2 to epigenetically \r\nsilence *FLOWERING LOCUS C* (*FLC*) during vernalization, is central to plants interpreting winter progression. \r\nHere, by a forward genetic screen, we identify two dominant mutations of the transcription factor NTL8 that \r\nconstitutively activate *VIN3* expression and alter the slow *VIN3* cold induction profile. In the wild type, \r\nthe NTL8 protein accumulates slowly in the cold, and directly upregulates *VIN3* transcription. Through \r\ncombining computational simulation and experimental validation, we show that a major contributor to this \r\nslow accumulation is reduced NTL8 dilution due to slow growth at low temperatures. Temperature-dependent \r\ngrowth is thus exploited through protein dilution to provide the long-term thermosensory information for \r\n*VIN3* upregulation. Indirect mechanisms involving temperature-dependent growth, in addition to direct \r\nthermosensing, may be widely relevant in long-term biological sensing of naturally fluctuating temperatures.",

    "year": "2020",
    "month": "Jan",
    "abstract": "In Arabidopsis thaliana, the cold-induced epigenetic regulation of *FLOWERING LOCUS C* (*FLC*) \r\ninvolves distinct phases of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) silencing. During cold, a PHD–PRC2 complex \r\nmetastably and digitally nucleates H3K27me3 within *FLC*. On return to warm, PHD–PRC2 spreads across the \r\nlocus delivering H3K27me3 to maintain long-term silencing. Here, we studied natural variation in this \r\nprocess in Arabidopsis accessions, exploring Lov-1, which shows *FLC* reactivation on return to warm, a \r\nfeature characteristic of *FLC* in perennial Brassicaceae. This analysis identifies an additional phase \r\nin this Polycomb silencing mechanism downstream from H3K27me3 spreading. In this long-term silencing \r\n(perpetuated) phase, the PHD proteins are lost from the nucleation region and silencing is likely \r\nmaintained by the read-write feedbacks associated with H3K27me3. A combination of noncoding SNPs in the \r\nnucleation region mediates instability in this long-term silencing phase with the result that Lov-1 *FLC* \r\nfrequently digitally reactivates in individual cells, with a probability that diminishes with increasing \r\ncold duration. We propose that this decrease in reactivation probability is due to reduced DNA replication \r\nafter flowering. Overall, this work defines an additional phase in the Polycomb mechanism instrumental in \r\nnatural variation of silencing, and provides avenues to dissect broader evolutionary changes at *FLC*.",

    "abstract": "Many organisms need to respond to complex, noisy environmental signals for developmental decision \r\nmaking.

We develop a mathematical model for vernalization that operates on \r\nmultiple timescales - long term (month), short term (day), and current (hour) - and is constrained by experimental \r\ndata. Our analysis demonstrates that temperature sensing is not localized to specific nodes within the *FLC* \r\nnetwork. Instead, temperature sensing is broadly distributed, with each thermosensory process responding to \r\nspecific features of the plants' history of exposure to warm and cold. The model accurately predicts *FLC* \r\nsilencing in new field data, allowing us to forecast *FLC* expression in changing climates.

    "abstract": "Plants integrate widely fluctuating temperatures to monitor seasonal progression. Here, we \r\ninvestigate the temperature signals in field conditions that result in vernalisation, the mechanism by \r\nwhich flowering is aligned with spring. We find that multiple, distinct aspects of the temperature profile \r\ncontribute to vernalisation. In autumn, transient cold temperatures promote transcriptional shutdown of \r\nArabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS C (*FLC*), independently of factors conferring epigenetic memory. As winter \r\ncontinues, expression of *VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE3* (*VIN3*), a factor needed for epigenetic silencing, is \r\nupregulated by at least two independent thermosensory processes. One integrates long-term cold temperatures, \r\nwhile the other requires the absence of daily temperatures above 15°C. The lack of spikes of high \r\ntemperature, not just prolonged cold, is thus the major driver for vernalisation. Monitoring of peak daily \r\ntemperature is an effective mechanism to judge seasonal progression, but is likely to have deleterious \r\nconsequences for vernalisation as the climate becomes more variable.",
